  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

}
Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
  this.isFlying = true;

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. "this" will default to global object in no-strict mode
  2. "this" points to the object on which the function is called
  3. "this" points to the object which is initialized using "new" keyword
  4. "this" refers to the context of an executing function
